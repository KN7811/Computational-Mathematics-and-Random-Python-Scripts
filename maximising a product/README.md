### This code concerns the solutions to the following problem:
For some <em>positive integer</em> $N$, how can we split $N$ into a sum, $\sum_i a_i = N$, such that the product of the individual terms of the sum, $\prod_i a_i$, is maximised.

For instance, in the case $N=11$, when we write $11 = 2.75+2.75+2.75+2.75$ and this is when the maximum product $2.75^4$ is achieved.

Note: the problem was first solved analytically and then a program coded to work for all $N$.
